# Developer

The Developer Perspective, added to the 4.2 OpenShift Console, provides developers with an optimized experience with the features and workflows they’re most likely to need to be productive.

## Main Use Cases 
The main use cases of the Developer Perspective include: 
- Utilizing the topology view to view resources 
- Adding resources to your topology 
- Monitoring your resources
- Modifying your resources 
- Enchancing the Developer Perspective with operators 

## Personas

Developers are one of the main types of users who might utilize the Developer Perspective. Some of the developer persona types we are designing for include the following.

### OpenShift Explorer 

The OpenShift Explorer is discovering and learning about OpenShift or new features in OpenShift, such as Pipelines or Serverless. The OpenShift Explorer expects efficient and intuitive workflows.

### Code Locator

The Code Locator brings up an IDE with the code associated with a service in OpenShift. The Code Locator does not spend a lot of time in the OpenShift console since they need to locate the associated code.

### Application Builder

The Application Builder wants to quickly assemble an application and spends most of their time in the IDE. The Application Builder wants to go into OpenShift and be able to quickly build and deploy an application.

### Application Deployer

The Application Deployer deploys applications to OpenShift from their IDE. The Application Deployer spends most of their time in the IDE but wants to view the status of builds, pipelines, and applications.  

### Application Monitor

I monitor the health of applications and their components.
I expect to be able to view the application topology and be able to easily understand the health status of the application as well as it’s components, so that i can identify areas to troubleshoot.
